#Make a Python program, which prompts the user name and two floating numbers.
# Multiply the inserted numbers to get product.
# Round the product in two decimal precision.
# Complete the program output as shown below.

#Example program run:

#Program starting.
#What is your name: John
#Enter a floating point number: 3.1
#Enter second floating point number: 5.3
#John you gave numbers 3.1 and 5.3
#Multiplying first and second number will result in product 16.43
#Program ending.
